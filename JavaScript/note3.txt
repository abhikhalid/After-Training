Now use align-items to help the frogs get to the bottom of the pond. This CSS property aligns items vertically and accepts the following values:

flex-start: Items align to the top of the container.
flex-end: Items align to the bottom of the container.
center: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
baseline: Items display at the baseline of the container.
stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.


---------------------------------------

The frogs need to get in the same order as their lilypads using flex-direction. This CSS property defines the direction items are placed in the container, and accepts the following values:

row: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
row-reverse: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
column: Items are placed top to bottom.
column-reverse: Items are placed bottom to top.


---------------------

 when the flex direction is a column, justify-content changes to the vertical and align-items to the horizontal.
